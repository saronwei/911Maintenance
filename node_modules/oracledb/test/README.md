See the License for the specific language governing permissions and

The node-oracledb test suite uses 'mocha', 'should' and 'async'.
See LICENSE.md for relevant licenses.

## 1. Preparations for running tests

### 1.1 Create a working directory

```
mkdir <some-directory>
cd <some-directory>
```

### 1.2 Install node-oracledb

See [INSTALL](https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
for installation requirements and more details.

Install with:

```
npm install oracledb
```

Alternatively use a GitHub clone:

```
git clone https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb.git
npm install node-oracledb
```

### 1.3 Install test-dependent modules

The test suite uses [mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha),
[async](https://www.npmjs.com/package/async) and
[should](https://www.npmjs.com/package/should).

```
cd <some-directory>/node_modules/oracledb
npm install
```

Note: Running `npm install` within oracledb/ directory will recompile
oracledb module and install all its dependent modules which are listed
in `devDependencies` field in `package.json` file. So 'mocha', 'async'
and 'should' modules are installed by this command.

### 1.4 Configure Database credentials

The database credentials for node-oracledb test suite are defined in dbconfig.js file.
You can set the credentials via environment variables or dbconfig.js file.
Change the credentials to a user who has privileges to connect and create tables.

```
vi <some-directory>/node_modules/oracledb/test/dbconfig.js
```

```javascript
module.exports = {
  user          : process.env.NODE_ORACLEDB_USER || "hr",
  password      : process.env.NODE_ORACLEDB_PASSWORD || "welcome",
  connectString : process.env.NODE_ORACLEDB_CONNECTIONSTRING || "localhost/orcl",
  externalAuth  : process.env.NODE_ORACLEDB_EXTERNALAUTH ? true : false
};
```

To use external authentication, set the `externalAuth` property to
`true`.  Also make sure Oracle Database and the authentication service
have been appropriately configured.  See
[Documentation for External Authentication](https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb/blob/master/doc/api.md#extauth)
for more details.

## 2. Running tests

### 2.1 Run the complete test suite

#### On Unix-like systems

```
cd <some-directory>/node_modules/oracledb
npm test
```

This calls the `test` script defined in `oracledb/package.json`.

#### On Windows

```
cd <some-directory>/node_modules/oracledb
npm run-script testWindows
```

This calls the `testWindows` script defined in `oracledb/package.json`.
See [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) for more infomation
about how npm handles the "scripts" field of `package.json`.

### 2.2 Run specified test(s)

```
cd <some-directory>/node_modules/oracledb
<mocha-executable-file-directory>/mocha test/<test-names>
```

See [mochajs.org](http://mochajs.org/) for more information on running tests with mocha.

## 3. Adding Tests
See [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for general information on contribution requirements.

For easy correlation between results and test code, each test is
assigned a number.  The following number ranges have been chosen:

- 1  - 20  are reserved for basic functional tests
- 21 - 50  are reserved for data type supporting tests
- 51 onwards are for other tests

## 4. Test List

See `test/list.txt` for the list of existing tests.
